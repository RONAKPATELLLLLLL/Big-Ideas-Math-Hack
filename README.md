## Note
- This respitory and other forks of this project would like to make it clear that we do not support or condone the use of our exploit for cheating or manipulating BIM assesments. Our exploit was developed for educational purposes only, as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities in the BIM system.
- I am not responsible for the actions of the people who use this to boost themselves economically, as i don't even use them in that way
